IPL Data Analytics Project


Overview
This project involves comprehensive data analysis of the Indian Premier League (IPL) using PySpark and a structured approach to data manipulation, transformation, and visualization. 
The goal is to extract meaningful insights from the IPL dataset, which includes match details, player performances, and team statistics.

Project Objectives
Data Cleaning and Preparation: Utilize PySpark to clean and preprocess the IPL dataset, ensuring data consistency and accuracy.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform detailed EDA to uncover patterns and trends in the data, including visualizing distributions, correlations, and key statistics.
Insight Generation: Generate actionable insights from the data, such as identifying top-performing players, most successful teams, and critical factors influencing match outcomes.
Visualization: Create interactive and static visualizations to present findings in a clear and engaging manner, making complex data accessible and understandable.

Key Components

Data Cleaning and Transformation:
Loading the IPL dataset into PySpark DataFrames.
Handling missing values, duplicates, and data inconsistencies.
Transforming data types and creating new features for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis:
Descriptive statistics and summary metrics.
Visualizing distributions and trends using PySpark and visualization libraries.
Correlation analysis and feature importance.

Insights and Reporting:
Identifying top players based on performance metrics.
Analyzing team performance and match outcomes.
Reporting key findings with visual aids and narratives.

Tools and Technologies
PySpark: For large-scale data processing and transformation.
Python: For scripting and additional data manipulation.
Visualization Libraries: Matplotlib, Seaborn, and PySpark's built-in functions.
Databricks Notebooks: For interactive analysis and documentation.

Project Architecture
Load Data in S3: Store IPL data in Amazon S3.
Read Data Using Apache Spark: Utilize PySpark to read data from S3.
Apply Transformations: Perform necessary data transformations.
SQL Queries for Insights: Execute SQL queries to analyze trends and generate insights.
Final Visualization: Create visualizations to present the findings.

Steps Performed
AWS Setup:
Created an IAM user.
Created an S3 bucket (bucket-ipl-da-project).
Uploaded dataset CSV files to the S3 bucket.
Changed permissions to make the bucket public.

Databricks Setup:
Created a Databricks account.
Created a compute cluster (ipl_da_prjct_cluster).
Created a new notebook (IPL_DA_Spark).
Connected the notebook to the created cluster.
Wrote and executed PySpark code in the notebook.

How to Run the Project
Setup: Ensure you have PySpark and Python installed in your environment.
Data Loading: Load the IPL dataset into PySpark DataFrames.
Data Processing: Execute the data cleaning and transformation scripts.
EDA: Run the exploratory data analysis notebook to generate visualizations and summary statistics.
Insight Generation: Execute the analysis scripts to derive insights and create reports.

Conclusion
This IPL Data Analytics Project demonstrates the power of PySpark in handling large datasets and provides valuable insights into the IPL's historical data. 
The project showcases skills in data cleaning, EDA, and data visualization.
